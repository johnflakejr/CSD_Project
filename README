CSD Board Project - Client/Server
#################################

Compiling: 
##########
Use "make" to compile the server. 
Use "make memcheck" to compile the server and run it with valgrind. Make sure to set the port and directory as well.

Running the Server: 
###################
Run the server with "./server PORT DIR"

Connecting to the Server: 
#########################
Use "python3 client.py IP PORT COMMAND FILENAME", where COMMAND can by "U" or "D". 

Some Design Notes: 
##################
- The server will strip path information from the client - "/etc/passwd" will be uploaded as "passwd" on the server.

- The server will pause for a moment to allow the client to parse the filesize before sending the information.
